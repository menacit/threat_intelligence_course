## Understanding the organisation
Resources (time, money and smart people)
are always limited.  

How do we best spend them?

What ensures the organisations survival (income, political support, legal permits, etc)?

What are their worst nightmares?
"Extinction level events?"

What are the organisations priorities?  

Let's use the CIA triad to get an idea!

## Psychotherapy clinic
Stores and processes highly sensitive information about patients.  

Leakage of healthcare data would harm patient trust and may have legal repercussions.  

Short-term inaccesbility of computer systems would be a nuisance, but likely manageable.

## Crisis information website
Designed to provide important guidance and information during natural disasters, war and similar.  

Availability is extremely important, but inaccurate (or even malicious) information may be worse.

## Retail bank
Processes thousands of transactions per second.  

Confidentiality, integrity and availability are all extremely important.  
  
Money can't be allowed to dissapear from customers accounts.

Priorities may shift if "incident duration" is specified/changed.  

May be hard to accurately use for a whole organisation - drill into different business areas.  

Just one of the ways you can wield the CIA triad.
