### Norwegian government intrusion
- Norway's department of security reports that 12 government ministries have suffered data breaches
- Attackers used 0-day flaw in a **M**obile **D**evice **M**anagement solution (CVE-2023-35078)
- Vulnerability could be used to gain authentication administrative access of MDM
- The software vendor has previously patched several similar flaws

### Norwegian government intrusion
- With great power comes great responsibility
- Security tools aren't necessarily secure tools
- Perhaps we should include "security track-record" in procurement process?

### CISA launches CyberSentry
- US government agency "CISA" published a press release about the new "CyberSentry program"
- Provide intrusion monitoring services and expertise to operators of critical infrastructure
- Voluntary participation for public and private entities

### CISA launches CyberSentry
- Method for circumventing political challenges
- Carrot, not stick
- May make even more sense in EU and Sweden

### Lemmy zero-day exploitation
- Catalin Cimpanu reports that several Lemmy instances have been compromised using a zero-day
- Patched within an hour after issue was reported
- Unknown threat actor

### Lemmy zero-day exploitation
- Monocultures are inherently vulnerable
- Sometimes it makes sense to wait for software to become battle hardened
- Lack of previous CVEs ain't necessarily a good security indicator

### Wiper attacks in Ukraine
- ESET Research has investigated cyberattacks against Ukraine
- Increase of cyberattacks since before full-scale invasion
- Mostly DDoS and wiper attacks, confirmed by Head of Cyber at SBU
- Commonly attributed to APT group "Sandworm" (Russian military intelligence agency)

### Wiper attacks in Ukraine
- When facing APTs, incidents will happen
- Fast cleanup/restoration seems to be key to success. Are we ready?
- Most organizations put availability first

### Microsoft cloud vulnerabilities
- Tenable published a blog post about Microsoft's handling of vulnerability reports
- Security flaw could be used by an unauthenticated attacker to access data of Azure customers
- Vulnerability was only properly patched after five months since initial report
- Controversy comes on the heels of Office 365 breach by Chinese APT

### Microsoft cloud vulnerabilities
- No one is "too big to fail"
- Even if managed services are in use, organizations should plan/prepare to handle data breaches
- E2EE is not just for paranoid individuals

### Real-world impact of WebAuthn
Okta released a blog post where they show how
phishers are desperately trying to circumvent FIDO2 authentication:

> Attention: To view your new tickets,
> you must temporarily remove your
> Yubikey authenticator for up to
> 6 hours, then proceed to: https: //....

### Real-world impact of WebAuthn
- Ain't all doom and gloom!
- Better security doesn't necessarily mean worse UX
- Low cost, large (demonstrable) impact
- How do we handle account recovery?

Have you come to any other conclusions?  
  
Hopefully this will serve as inspiration!
