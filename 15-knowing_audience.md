We gather threat intelligence to help
groups and individuals protect themselves.  
  
Ideally, change their behavior and invest
in suitable supporting technology.
  
How do we maximize the value of that
information and our hard work?

Targeting communication based on:
- Role / Responsibilities
- Technical skills
- Domain specific knowledge
- Bandwidth

What do you think are the most important
take-aways for _role X_? (desires/responsibilities)
  
How do you want them to react (_mohaha_)?

## CTO
_Should we migrate our sensitive applications
to a public cloud provider in country X?_
  
_How much effort should we spend on migrating
away from platform X that is **E**nd-**o**f-**L**ife
and no longer updated by the vendor?_
  
_Should the development teams standardise on
usage of programming language X or Y?_

## CISO
**C**hief **I**nformation **S**ecurity **O**fficer.  
  
Reports to CTO, CSO or CEO.
  
Often acts as counter-balance to CTO.  
  
Help them filter out the noise and produce
sound-bites/ammunition.
  
Lessons learned from incidents affecting
competitors and similar organisations
are usually an effective tool.

In the marketing field, **personas** are
often used to focus communication efforts.
  
Fictional character that represents
