### Exercise: Match the threat actor
Participants are split into groups.  
  
Each group will be provided with descriptions of fictional organisations and threat actors.  

For each organisation, motivate and define their priorities/needs using the CIA triad.

For each threat actor, motivate and rank (1 to 5) how "attractive" each target organisation is.

Use liberal amounts of imagination/guesstimation. After presentation, send slides as PDF to:
**[courses+ti_010401@%EMAIL_DOMAIN%](mailto:courses+ti_010401@%EMAIL_DOMAIN%)**

Needs/security priorities based on CIA triad.

### Confidentiality
The organisation makes money by selling highly valuable information.

Customers pay for the advantage, value proposition fails otherwise.

## Org: XMPLE Prospecting Inc.
Needs/security priorities based on CIA triad.

### Availability
While the organisation relies on computer systems
to aid prospecting, its main strengths are expert
knowledge and customer relations.

Temporary inaccessibility of IT environment
is not deemed a major business risk.

## Threat actor: Crocs4Justice
Loosely organised group of "left-leaning" hacktivists.  

Hacks for fun and as a political action.

Utilize DDoS, defacement and information leaks against their targets.  

Known to use publicly available exploits and seem to lack deep technical knowledge/funding.

## Org: XMPLE Prospecting Inc.
How well does the organisation match the threat actors focus/interest?

### Crocs4Justice: 3
While the threat actor likely objects to the business ("aiding ecological destruction") of
the target organisation, it is far from a household name and the PR gains would be small.
May attack the organisation opportunistically, but won't spend much effort on the target.

How well does the organisation match the threat actors focus/interest?

### Savory Bear: 5
Information produced by the target organisation may be of high value to the Russian state.
Central Asia is perceived as their historical sphere of influence and large energy deposits
could greatly change international interest in the region. Early access to the information
could allow state-friendly actors to quickly exploit the resources and gain an edge/presence.

Bonus points for verbosity,
group participation and fancy design!

Again: imagination is encouraged!
